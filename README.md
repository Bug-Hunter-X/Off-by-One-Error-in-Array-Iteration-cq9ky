This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The bug.java file contains the erroneous code that causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bugSolution.java file provides the corrected code with the loop condition changed to i < arr.length to avoid the error. This is a common mistake in programming that can lead to unexpected program crashes or incorrect results.
